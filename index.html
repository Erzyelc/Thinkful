            <h3 class="headers">About Me</h3>
            <p>
              I have always had a passion for creating things as well as
              technology, after graduating high school I was not sure the best
              way to combine these two interests. However, eventually I
              discovered programming which helped mold both interests into one.
              This is when I found Thinkful and decided to pursure a career as a
              software engineer. Thinkful allows me to get a better
              understanding of programming and also allows me to get the option
              to work with other people, I enjoy the opportunity to work with
              others and get a better understanding for how other people
              percieve certain isues.
